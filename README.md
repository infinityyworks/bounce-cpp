# Bounce
Simple bouncing simulation inside a terminal window using the ncurses library



# Installation
Here are the commands to install the ncurses library on different linux distros:

### Debian/Ubuntu

sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev

### CentOS/RHEL/Fedora 21 or older

sudo yum install ncurses-devel

### Fedora 22.x+

sudo dnf install ncurses-devel



To build the source code, just run *make* and then run the executable using *./game*

(I haven't tested any of this outside ubuntu)
